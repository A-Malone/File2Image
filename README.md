File2Image
=======

A program I made improving on a hackathon project I once saw. This program encodes any file into a 48 bit colour depth PNG, with the low byte of each colour corresponding to the file data. The high byte is set to the corresponding data from a mask image, concealling any file under what appears to be a normal image. 

I'm currently working on a python script that would allow me to transfer these files to image sharing services for secure, and practically limitless cloud storage.
